# Google Homepage Simulator

In this project, I will attempt to emulate the Google homepage by myself using mainly HTML and CSS skills I learnt from freecodecamp as well as previous projects in CS50x.

## What I learnt
- More familiar with Flexbox CSS
- Brief usage of Grid CSS
- Nuances of CSS and the box model

## What I need to improve on
- Practice more and become more familiar
